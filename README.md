# Recommender System

This notebook shows how to create a simple recommendation system using trip advisor data. I created two simple systems: 

+ the first ranks all top rated restaurants and return the best ones in the city and price that best suit you.  
+ the second one gives a list of recommendations based on a restaurant you have enjoyed in the past. For example, if you enjoyed "Gordon Ramsays' Restaurant" in London, the system tell you which restaurants are similar to it, in a city that you decide. 

To use this code, download this repository on your machine and launch jupyter notebook. Run the scrip and input what the application requires.
